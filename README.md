## BeatMaker

Script for resynthesis of sound and pitch. The program transforms and/or combines speech audios into beat 
and melodic resynthesized objects for pronunciation teaching purposes as well as it automatically plots the fundamental frequency contours of both native and foreign language.

The program also creates a TextGrid file with the words and the utterance automatically segmented based on the reference audio to align with the melodic contours.

# WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND USING - AT MOST - TWO AUDIO FILES PER FOLDER for the sake of a finer comparison (see audio and text files in this repository for tests)
