Script for resynthesis of sound and pitch. The program transform speech audios into beat 
and melodic objects for pronunciation teaching purposes.

The program creates a TextGrid file with the words and the utterance automatically segmented based on the reference audio and txt files.

# User's manual preparation!

# WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND USING - AT MOST - TWO AUDIO FILES PER FOLDER for the sake of a finer comparison (see audio and txt files in this repository for tests)
