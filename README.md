Script for resynthesis of sound and pitch. The program transform speech audios into beat 
and melodic objects for pronunciation teaching purposes as well as it automatically plots the fundamental frequency contours of both native and foreign language

The program also creates a TextGrid file with the words and the utterance automatically segmented based on the reference audio to align withe the melodic contours

# User's manual preparation!

# WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND USING - AT MOST - TWO AUDIO FILES PER FOLDER for the sake of a finer comparison (see audio and txt files in this repository for tests)
